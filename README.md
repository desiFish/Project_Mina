> In Sanskrit, "Mina" (मीन) represents the fish, symbolizing freedom, fluidity, and the eternal flow of life. Just as fish navigate the depths with graceful purpose, this project aims to create harmony between technology and aquatic life. The name embodies our philosophy of maintaining balance in the artificial ecosystems we create, guided by ancient wisdom yet powered by modern innovation.
